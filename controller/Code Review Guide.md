# Code Review Guide

Code to be reviewed

Dear reviewers, 

Welcome to our code review guide. We have chosen our XML management class, `ProfileManager`, for review. This class reads and writes XML data for users of our program and forms a crucial part of our backend. We kindly request you to follow this guide for reviewing our code. We greatly appreciate your time and feedback.

## User Stories
The code we have selected supports the following user stories:
1. As a user, I can create a profile with my username and email.
2. As a user, I can add a project associated with my profile. The project includes details like name, start date, end date, and budget.
3. As a user, I can add an item with details such as name, description, cost per unit, and quantity to a project associated with my profile.

## Design Diagrams
The `ProfileManager` class is a part of our design diagrams and it handles the creation, reading, and writing of user profiles in XML format. The class diagram can be found in our repository.

## Code Location and Files
The code can be found in our repository at `src/main/java/com/ourproject/ProfileManager.java` (this is an example location - replace it with your actual file path). 
You can access our design diagrams at `docs/design_diagrams/`.

## Coding Conventions
We have followed standard Java conventions for our code. For instance, we use camelCase for naming variables and methods, PascalCase for class names, and all uppercase for constants. We have also followed conventions related to indentation, braces, and comment styles. We have adhered to the principle of making methods do one thing and ensuring that they are not excessively long.

## Instructions for Code Review
Please follow the below checklist while reviewing our code:

1. **Clarity**: Check if the code and its purpose is clear. Look for meaningful variable and method names.
2. **Consistency**: Check if coding conventions are followed consistently throughout the code.
3. **Comments**: Verify if the code is well-commented, and the comments accurately explain the logic of the code.
4. **Error Handling**: Check if exceptions are handled correctly and informative messages are displayed.
5. **Optimization**: Evaluate if there are any possibilities for code optimization or refactoring.
6. **Testability**: Assess if the code is written in a way that makes it easy to test.

We have also added inline comments in our code to provide a better understanding of its logic.

Once again, thank you for your time and effort. We look forward to your constructive feedback.
